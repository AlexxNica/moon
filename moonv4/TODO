Here is a list of what must be done to have complete version of the Moon platform.

Architecture

- Add a complete logging system
- Replace moon_orchestrator with Kubernetes ?
- Add a load balancer (HAProxy ?)
- Update Consul with Consul-Template ?
- Develop the Moon hook in Oslo_Policy

Actions that must be done before the next version:

- manage a token/uuid (ie session ID) in the moon_interface component
- update RabbitMQ connections in security_function to have work queues instead of RPC
- add a timestamps in moon_router to know if the database has been modified
- rename moon_db and moon_utilities because they are not container but just libraries
- work on moonclient because it doesn't work with the new data model
- check all input from moon_interface (check that input data are correct and safe)
- Move @enforce from moon_db to API in Moon_Manager
- Need to work on unit tests with the new data model
- Allow to have multiple moon_interface in parallel (needed for load balancing)

Bugs to fix:

- Connect the authz functionality with the enforce decorator
- The intra_extension ID parameter must be given when the container is ran and not when it is build
  (security_function)
- When a container is deleted, the reference is not deleted from CONTAINERS in orchestrator
- All request to moon_interface generally end with a 200 HTTP code even if there is an error

Other actions:

- Some cleaning in all classes
- Write Installation procedures
- Write User and administrator documentation
- Run unit tests
- Add and run integration tests
- moon_orchestrator in a docker
- Add security on RabbitMQ transactions (auth+crypt)
